            <h3>Wealth accumulation for a desirable future</h3>
            <p>Multiple potential returns to accelerate wealth building</p>
            <ul>
                The Plan is a participating insurance plan that offers you potential capital growth. Its policy value
                consists of the following components:
                <li>Guaranteed cash value grows over the policy years helping you accumulate wealth.</li>
                <li>Terminal dividend1 is a one-off non-guaranteed dividend, which is payable from the 5th policy
                    anniversary upon certain events.
                </li>
                <li>Total amount of terminal dividend management account2 is equivalent to locked-in terminal dividend
                    and accumulated interest3 (if any) less withdrawal amount (if any).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Terminal dividend management option to help you lock in gains
            </p>
            <p>To facilitate your financial need, starting from the 15th policy anniversary and every policy anniversary
                thereafter, you can apply to exercise the “terminal dividend management option”2 to lock in a designated
                percentage of the terminal dividend of the policy. This option can only be exercised once for each
                policy year. The minimum percentage for each application is 10% and the maximum aggregate percentage of
                all applications is 50%. The terminal dividend which is applied to lock in will be transferred to the
                terminal dividend management account and will become locked-in terminal dividend. The locked-in terminal
                dividend will then be guaranteed and will accumulate with interest3 (if any) at a non-guaranteed rate.
                You may also withdraw from the terminal dividend management account for extra liquidity.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Flexible access to your wealth to match your needs</h3>
            <p>To realize your financial goals, you can partially withdraw the guaranteed cash value and terminal
                dividend1 (if any) through reducing the basic amount4. The policy value will be reduced accordingly
                while the total amount of terminal dividend management account2 (if any) will remain unchanged.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can apply for policy loan to borrow part of the guaranteed cash value when needed,
                while keeping the policy in force. Interest on policy loan which is not guaranteed will be charged at a
                rate determined by us from time to time.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Build a legacy for future generations</h3>
            <p>Unlimited change of insured to pass on wealth across generations</p>
            <p>We understand you wish to provide your loved ones with a secure financial future. This is why the Plan
                features the “change of insured option”5, allowing you to change the insured starting from the 10th
                policy anniversary for unlimited times while the insured is alive. The benefit term of the policy will
                be extended to age 138 of the new insured upon each change, giving your wealth more time to grow and
                pass on through generations.</p>
            <p>Contingent insured to sustain insurance coverage</p>
            <p>You can appoint and prioritize a maximum of 2 contingent insureds6 at a time starting from the 10th
                policy anniversary while the insured is alive and the policy is in force. In case the insured
                unfortunately passes away, we will arrange the contingent insured who is first in line to be the new
                insured according to relevant administrative procedures and orders. The policy will continue to be
                effective so as to protect your legacy for future generations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Life protection provides peace of mind to your loved ones</h3>
            <p>Death benefit</p>
            <ul>
                In case the insured unfortunately passes away while the policy is in force and there is no contingent
                insured under the policy, we will pay the beneficiary a death benefit which is equal to the higher of:
                <li>
                    101% of accumulated premium due and paid of the basic plan; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    sum of guaranteed cash value and terminal dividend1 (if any) of the basic plan at the date of death
                    of the insured,
                    plus total amount of terminal dividend management account2(if any), less all indebtedness (if any).
                    The policy will be terminated after we pay the death benefit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Contingent insured to sustain insurance coverage</p>
            <p>You can appoint and prioritize a maximum of 2 contingent insureds6 at a time starting from the 10th
                policy anniversary while the insured is alive and the policy is in force. In case the insured
                unfortunately passes away, we will arrange the contingent insured who is first in line to be the new
                insured according to relevant administrative procedures and orders. The policy will continue to be
                effective so as to protect your legacy for future generations.</p>
            <p>
                Additional death benefit
            </p>
            <ul>
                In the event the insured unfortunately passes away within the first 10 policy years while the policy is
                in force, apart from death benefit, we will pay the beneficiary an additional death benefit which is
                equal to the lower of:
                <li>
                    100% of basic amount of the basic plan; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    the maximum additional death benefit amount as stated in the below table.

                Planner issued by the Company in respect of the same insured shall not exceed the maximum additional

            <p>Death benefit and additional death benefit settlement option</p>
            <p>While the insured is alive, you can choose how the death benefit and additional death benefit (if any)
                are to be paid to safeguard your family’s financial future. You can choose to settle the benefits in a
                lump sum or by installments7 with a fixed amount in cash annually over a fixed payment term of 10 or 20
                years.</p>
            <p>If the total amount of death benefit at the date of the insured’s death is less than
                HKD400,000/USD50,000, or the policyholder has not confirmed any settlement option of death benefit and
                additional death benefit (if any) before the date of death of the insured, we will pay out the benefit
                amount to the beneficiary in a lump sum.</p>

                        Terminal dividend is a one-off dividend and is non-guaranteed. Amount of terminal dividend shown
                        in proposal illustration is just an indicative figure. Declared terminal dividend is not
                        perpetually attached to the policy. It may be reduced or increased at subsequent declarations.
                        Its actual amount will only be determined when it becomes payable. The actual amount may be
                        lower or higher than the projected figure. Under some circumstances, actual amount of terminal
                        dividend may be zero. The amount of the terminal dividend is affected by various factors
                        including but not limited to the performance of the underlying investments, so the amount is
                        relatively volatile and will move up and down over time. China Life (Overseas) reserves the
                        right to revise the terminal dividend from time to time. Past record is not necessarily
                        indicative of future result. For more information, please refer to clause 5 and clause 6 under
                        “Important information” and “Non-guaranteed benefit” risk of the product brochure of the Plan.
                        Starting from the 5th policy anniversary, the terminal dividend shall be paid upon the
                        occurrence of the earliest of the following conditions:
                        <li>
                            when the Company pays the death benefit (only applicable if the sum of guaranteed cash value
                            and terminal dividend of the basic plan at the date of death of the insured is higher than
                            101% of accumulated premium due and paid of the basic plan);
                        </li>
                        <li>when the policy is surrendered by the policyholder; or</li>
                        <li>when the policy reaches the policy maturity date.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For application to exercise the “terminal dividend management option”, such application must be
                    received by the Company within 30 days from the relevant policy anniversary (including the date of
                    policy anniversary). The option will only be exercised provided that the application fulfills the
                    application requirement and is confirmed by the Company. There is no limitation on the number of
                    times of exercising this option when the policy is in force, but the policyholder can apply to
                    exercise this option in writing only once for each policy year. The Company will process the
                    exercise of this option only once for each written application. There must be no unpaid premium or
                    indebtedness in the policy during application to exercise this option. The amount of locked-in
                    terminal dividend is guaranteed after the Company’s approval of the application. Once the
                    application is approved by the Company, the terminal dividend which is applied to lock in will be
                    transferred to the terminal dividend management account as soon as practicable and will become
                    locked-in terminal dividend. The locked-in terminal dividend will be deposited with the Company to
                    accumulate interest (if any) and the interest (if any) will be accrued annually at a rate to be
                    determined by the Company at its sole discretion from time to time. You can submit request to the
                    Company to withdraw part or all of the locked-in terminal dividend and accumulated interest (if any)
                    from terminal dividend management account in a lump sum without surrendering the policy. The
                    withdrawal amount is subject to minimum requirement imposed by the Company from time to time. The
                    actual amount of the locked-in terminal dividend will only be determined after the application has
                    been approved by the Company. The total amount of terminal dividend management account is equivalent
                    to locked-in terminal dividend and accumulated interest (if any) less withdrawal amount (if any)
                    from the terminal dividend management account. Upon the completion of transferring the terminal
                    dividend to the terminal dividend management account by the Company as per application, the terminal
                    dividend (if any) of the relevant policy year will be adjusted proportionally. The terminal dividend
                    (if any) of subsequent policy years will be adjusted proportionally. Locked-in terminal dividend
                    will not be allowed to be reset or reversed to terminal dividend. For details, please refer to the

                </li>
                <li>For the installment option, the remaining balance of death benefit and additional death benefit (if
                    any) will be deposited in the policy to accumulate interest (if any) until the end of the payment
                    term. The interest will be calculated on an annual basis and it is non-guaranteed which will be
                    determined by us from time to time. The accumulated interest (if any) will be paid together with the
                    last installment of death benefit and additional death benefit (if any). If the beneficiary(ies)
                    dies at any time before the Company has fully paid the death benefit and additional death benefit
                    (if any), the Company shall pay the remaining balance of the death benefit and additional death
